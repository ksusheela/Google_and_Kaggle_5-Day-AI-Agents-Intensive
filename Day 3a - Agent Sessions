Here are some of the key areas where advancements are happening right now:\n\n**1. AI-Powered Target Identification & Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering Novel Biological Targets:** AI algorithms are sifting through massive datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, clinical data) to identify previously unknown genes, proteins, or pathways that are implicated in diseases. This is moving beyond well-understood targets.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are becoming better at assessing whether a newly identified target is likely to be responsive to drug intervention, saving resources on \"undruggable\" targets.\n*   **Understanding Disease Mechanisms:** AI helps researchers unravel complex biological networks, revealing how diseases progress at a molecular level, which is crucial for identifying effective intervention points.\n\n**2. Accelerating Small Molecule and Biologic Design:**\n\n*   **Generative Chemistry:** AI, particularly generative models (like GANs and diffusion models), can now design novel molecular structures with desired properties from scratch. This is a significant departure from traditional trial-and-error methods.\n*   **Optimizing Existing Molecules:** AI can suggest modifications to existing drug candidates to improve their efficacy, reduce toxicity, enhance their pharmacokinetic properties (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes a drug), or overcome resistance mechanisms.\n*   **De Novo Protein Design:** For biologics (like antibodies or therapeutic proteins), AI can design entirely new protein sequences with specific functions, opening doors for novel therapeutic modalities.\n*   **Example:** Companies like **NVIDIA** (with its BioNeMo platform), **Exscientia**, **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, and **Atomwise** are at the forefront of using AI for molecular design.\n\n**3. Revolutionizing Preclinical Testing and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Predictive Toxicology:** AI models are being developed to predict potential toxic side effects of drug candidates early in the discovery process, reducing the need for extensive animal testing and identifying risks sooner.\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can simulate how millions of potential compounds would interact with a target in a virtual environment, drastically narrowing down the pool of candidates for experimental validation.\n*   **Optimizing Formulation and Delivery:** AI can help predict how different formulations might affect drug stability, solubility, and delivery within the body.\n\n**4. Advancements in Specific Therapeutic Areas:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** AI is being heavily utilized to discover new cancer targets, predict patient response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, and design personalized cancer treatments.\n*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** AI is aiding in the identification of biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** AI is being used to discover novel antibiotics, antivirals, and to predict the emergence of new pathogens and their resistance patterns.\n\n**5. Integration of Multi-Modal Data:**\n\n*   **Combining Diverse Data Sources:** The most powerful AI applications in drug discovery are now integrating data from genomics, proteomics, imaging, electronic health records, and even scientific literature to create a more holistic understanding of disease and drug action.\n\n**6. Focus on Specific Modalities:**\n\n*   **RNA Therapeutics:** AI is playing a role in designing more stable and effective RNA-based therapies (like mRNA vaccines and siRNA drugs).\n*   **Peptide Therapeutics:** AI is being used to discover and design novel therapeutic peptides.\n\n**Key Trends to Watch:**\n\n*   **\"AI-First\" Drug Discovery Companies:** A new wave of companies is being built from the ground up with AI at their core, rather than trying to integrate AI into existing R&D processes.\n*   **The Rise of Explainable AI (XAI):** While AI can generate novel drug candidates, understanding *why* a particular molecule is predicted to be effective is crucial for regulatory approval and scientific validation. XAI aims to make AI's decision-making process more transparent.\n*   **Increased Collaboration:** Pharmaceutical giants are increasingly partnering with or acquiring AI-driven biotech companies to leverage their expertise.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges persist, including:\n\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still require rigorous experimental validation in labs and clinical trials.\n*   **Data Gaps and Biases:** Ensuring comprehensive and unbiased datasets for AI training is an ongoing effort.\n*   **Regulatory Pathways:** The regulatory framework for AI-discovered and designed drugs is still evolving.\n*   **Integration into Wet Labs:** Bridging the gap between AI predictions and practical laboratory execution.\n\nIn essence, AI is not just optimizing drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing how new medicines are conceived, designed, and tested, promising to bring effective treatments to patients faster and more efficiently than ever before.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned in my previous answer, which was:\n\n**Accelerating Small Molecule and Biologic Design:**\n\nThis is a really exciting area because it directly addresses the core of drug discovery: creating the actual molecules that can interact with biological targets to treat disease.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what this entails:\n\n**1. Generative Chemistry (for Small Molecules):**\n\n*   **What it is:** Traditionally, medicinal chemists would synthesize and test thousands of molecules based on their knowledge, intuition, and existing chemical libraries. Generative chemistry uses AI models (often inspired by techniques used in image generation or language processing) to **create entirely new molecular structures** that have never been seen before.\n*   **How it works (simplified):** These AI models are trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. They learn the \"rules\" of chemical structures and how certain structures correlate with desired properties (like binding affinity to a target, solubility, or low toxicity). Then, they can generate novel molecules that are predicted to possess these desired characteristics.\n*   **Key Advancements:**\n    *   **Designing for Multiple Properties Simultaneously:** Early generative models might focus on one property (e.g., binding to a target). Newer models can optimize for several properties at once, such as efficacy, safety, and manufacturability, making the generated molecules more \"drug-like\" from the outset.\n    *   **Controllable Generation:** Researchers can guide the AI by setting specific parameters (e.g., \"design a molecule that binds to protein X and has low predicted liver toxicity\").\n    *   **Scaffolds and Fragments:** AI can suggest novel core structures (scaffolds) or ways to connect existing molecular fragments to create new drug candidates.\n*   **Impact:** This drastically expands the chemical space that can be explored, potentially uncovering novel drug classes that might have been missed through traditional methods. It reduces the time and resources spent on synthesizing and testing molecules that are unlikely to work.\n\n**2. Optimizing Existing Molecules:**\n\n*   **What it is:** Even if a promising molecule is found, it often needs refinement. AI can suggest specific modifications to improve its performance.\n*   **How it works:** AI models can predict the impact of adding, removing, or changing specific atoms or chemical groups within a molecule. They can identify \"weak spots\" or areas where a molecule's interaction with its target or its behavior in the body could be improved.\n*   **Examples of Optimization:**\n    *   **Improving Binding Affinity:** Making the drug stick more strongly to its target.\n    *   **Increasing Selectivity:** Ensuring the drug binds only to the intended target and not others, reducing off-target side effects.\n    *   **Enhancing Pharmacokinetics (ADME):** Improving Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion so the drug stays in the body long enough to be effective and is cleared appropriately.\n    *   **Overcoming Resistance:** Designing drugs that are effective against mutated targets that have developed resistance to older drugs.\n*   **Impact:** This iterative refinement process is crucial for turning a \"lead compound\" into a viable drug candidate. AI can do this much faster and more systematically than human intuition alone.\n\n**3. De Novo Protein Design (for Biologics):**\n\n*   **What it is:** This applies similar generative principles to proteins, which are much larger and more complex than small molecules. Proteins are used as therapeutics (e.g., antibodies, enzymes).\n*   **How it works:** AI models can predict how different amino acid sequences will fold into 3D structures and how those structures will interact with targets. They can then design novel protein sequences with specific functionalities that don't exist in nature.\n*   **Applications:**\n    *   **Designing novel antibodies:** With improved binding or other characteristics.\n    *   **Creating custom enzymes:** For therapeutic purposes or industrial applications.\n    *   **Developing protein-based scaffolds:** For drug delivery or diagnostics.\n*   **Impact:** This opens up a new frontier for biologics, allowing for the creation of bespoke protein therapeutics tailored precisely to a disease.\n\n**Companies and Platforms Involved:**\n\nSeveral companies are heavily invested in this area, often with specialized AI platforms:\n\n*   **Exscientia:** Known for its AI platform that designs novel drug candidates and has brought several AI-designed drugs into clinical trials.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses a combination of AI, automation, and biological experiments to discover drugs for rare diseases and oncology.\n*   **Atomwise:** Specializes in using deep learning for small molecule drug discovery, screening vast libraries and designing novel compounds.\n*   **NVIDIA (BioNeMo):** Provides a platform and tools for AI-driven drug discovery, including generative models for molecules and proteins.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Focuses on AI-driven end-to-end drug discovery, from target identification to molecule generation.\n\nIn essence, AI's ability to learn complex chemical and biological rules and then generate novel entities based on those rules is fundamentally accelerating the process of designing the very drugs we hope will treat diseases. It's moving from a process of \"finding\" molecules to one of \"designing\" them with specific, desired outcomes in mind.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the main companies involved in **accelerating small molecule and biologic design** using AI.

Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.
