What if you could distribute the workload, foster collaboration, and build more robust, intelligent applications with ease? Enter Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a powerful paradigm that’s not just for AI researchers anymore. For software developers, understanding and implementing MAS can unlock new levels of efficiency and innovation.\n\nAt its core, a MAS involves multiple \"agents\" – autonomous entities capable of perception, reasoning, and action within an environment. Think of them as intelligent, independent workers. The real magic happens when these agents interact, communicate, and coordinate. This collaboration allows them to achieve complex goals that a single agent or traditional monolithic system simply couldn't handle. Unlike simple multi-threading, MAS offers emergent intelligence and dynamic adaptability.\n\nFrom a development standpoint, MAS champions modularity. Breaking down complex software into smaller, specialized agents simplifies development, debugging, and maintenance. Each agent can be developed and tested independently, streamlining the entire process. Furthermore, MAS naturally scales. Need to handle more load? Just add more agents. This distributed nature also makes systems more resilient; the failure of one agent doesn't bring down the whole application. And let's not forget speed – agents can work on different tasks concurrently, dramatically speeding up execution for intensive processes.\n\nBeyond efficiency, MAS significantly enhances software intelligence. Agents can learn from their environment and interactions, leading to applications that adapt dynamically to changing conditions. This capability is invaluable for tackling intricate problems requiring sophisticated reasoning, like optimization or resource management. They can also act as intelligent intermediaries, facilitating more natural human-computer interaction.\n\nMulti-Agent Systems are no longer a niche concept. By embracing this paradigm, software developers can build systems that are not only more efficient and scalable but also smarter, more adaptable, and ultimately, more valuable. It's time to explore MAS and unlock the next frontier in software engineering.\nEditorAgent > ## Level Up Your Code: How Multi-Agent Systems Are Revolutionizing Software Development\n\nDo your software projects often feel like a juggling act with too many elements to manage? Imagine a world where you could effortlessly distribute workloads, foster seamless collaboration, and construct more robust, intelligent applications with greater ease. This is the promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) – a powerful paradigm that transcends the realm of AI research and offers significant advantages to everyday software developers. Embracing MAS can unlock new levels of efficiency and innovation in your development process.\n\nAt its heart, a MAS comprises multiple \"agents.\" These are autonomous entities, each capable of perceiving its environment, reasoning about its observations, and taking appropriate actions. Picture them as a team of intelligent, independent workers. The true power of MAS emerges when these agents interact, communicate, and coordinate their efforts. This collaborative dynamic allows them to tackle complex goals that would be insurmountable for a single agent or a traditional, monolithic system. Critically, MAS distinguishes itself from simple multi-threading by offering emergent intelligence and dynamic adaptability.\n\nFor software developers, the MAS paradigm champions modularity. By breaking down intricate software into smaller, specialized agents, you inherently simplify development, debugging, and maintenance. Each agent can be developed and tested in isolation, significantly streamlining the entire lifecycle. Moreover, MAS provides natural scalability. Facing increased demand? Simply introduce more agents. This distributed architecture also enhances system resilience; the failure of a single agent does not necessarily cripple the entire application. And the benefits don't stop there – agents can concurrently work on different tasks, dramatically accelerating execution times for computationally intensive processes.\n\nBeyond mere efficiency, MAS profoundly enhances software intelligence. Agents have the capacity to learn from their environment and their interactions with other agents. This leads to applications that can dynamically adapt to changing conditions and user needs. This adaptive capability is invaluable for tackling sophisticated problems that demand advanced reasoning, such as optimization, resource management, or complex simulations. Furthermore, agents can serve as intelligent intermediaries, facilitating more natural and intuitive human-computer interactions.\n\nMulti-Agent Systems are rapidly moving from a niche concept to a mainstream development approach. By adopting this paradigm, software developers can build systems that are not only more efficient, scalable, and resilient but also demonstrably smarter, more adaptable, and ultimately, more valuable. It's time to explore the exciting world of MAS and unlock the next frontier in software engineering.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👏 Great job!

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T21:00:10.963773Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T21:00:10.964049Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T21:00:10.969635Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-11T21:00:10.964004Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T21:00:10.968531Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":22},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

Symbols he'd never seen before pulsed at intersections, hinting at forgotten coastlines and submerged wonders. A treasure map? Or a warning?

What are his thoughts on his solitary life? Does he have any regrets, or is he content? A brief internal reflection could make him more relatable and his potential new journey more impactful. For instance, perhaps he harbors a secret longing for adventure, which would make the map's discovery even more significant.\n\n*   **Sensory Details of the Map:** The description of the map is good with \"smooth and leathery,\" \"swirling lines,\" and \"trapped moonlight.\" However, to enhance the mystery, consider adding another sensory detail. Does it emit a faint sound? A subtle warmth? A peculiar scent? For example, does it smell faintly of ozone or ancient salt? These small additions can amplify its otherworldly nature.\n\n*   **Pacing of the Discovery:** The discovery of the map is quite immediate. While this creates a sense of urgency, consider a slightly more drawn-out reveal. Perhaps Elias notices a strange light seeping from the stone, leading him to investigate. This minor delay could build suspense and make the moment of finding the parchment feel more earned and dramatic.\nRefinerAgent > The salt spray stung Elias's weathered face as he trimmed the lamp, the rhythmic sweep of the beam a familiar counterpoint to the ocean's ceaseless roar. Another night, another lonely vigil. He'd long ago made peace with the solitude, though sometimes, in the deepest hours before dawn, a wistful ache for a life less ordinary would surface. He’d traded the world’s clamor for the sea’s embrace, a trade he rarely regretted, but tonight, the familiar comfort of routine was shattered.\n\nA peculiar, faint luminescence seeped from beneath a loose stone near the tower's base, catching his eye. Curiosity, a long-dormant ember, flickered to life. Kneeling, Elias worked his fingers around the stone, dislodging it to reveal a rolled parchment pulsing with an otherworldly glow. Unfurling it carefully, he gasped. It wasn't paper, but something smooth and leathery, cool to the touch, emitting a faint scent of ozone and ancient salt. Swirling lines shifted and glowed like trapped moonlight, and at their intersections, symbols he'd never seen before pulsed with a life of their own, hinting at forgotten coastlines and submerged wonders.\n\nA tremor ran through Elias, a mix of trepidation and exhilaration. This was no mere treasure map; it felt ancient, imbued with a power that both beckoned and warned. Was this the adventure he'd unknowingly yearned for, or a perilous siren's call? The lighthouse beam swept across the ink-dark sea, a solitary guardian of the known. But Elias's gaze was fixed on the glowing enigma in his hands, a new, far more profound journey now etched not on parchment, but within his very soul.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.
